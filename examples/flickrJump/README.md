Flickr Jump
================================

This app fetches a random equirectangular photo from the Flickr API, and sets it as the scene's sky. The user has the option to request another random sky. You can also pass an optional parametar to filter the results.

This demo intends to illustrate a key advantage of using A-Frame in conjunction with Meteor, which is the latter's powerful reactive capabilities. As you can see from the source code, by using this stack, we can achieve the desired functionality in roughly 200 lines of code.
